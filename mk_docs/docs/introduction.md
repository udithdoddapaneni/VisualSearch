# ViZearch Overview

## Introduction

ViZearch is an advanced semantic search platform designed specifically for image and video content. It leverages computer vision models and efficient search technologies to enable intuitive search across media collections.

## Core Concept

At its core, ViZearch transforms the way users interact with visual media collections. Instead of relying on manually tagged metadata or filenames, ViZearch allows users to search using keywords / descriptions of what they're looking for.
Also, it has "strict" feature which checks for all the words in the search string.
And in normal searh, we can use boolean characters like AND/OR/NOT for better results

For example, a user can search for:

- "cat AND dog" -> get images with cat and dog.
-  "cat and dog" -> get images containing either *cat* or *dog* or the word *and*.
- "cat and dog" with strict feature -> behaves like "cat AND dog"

The system processes these queries and returns relevant images and videos that match the semantic content of the query.

## How It Works

ViZearch operates through a pipeline of different components:

1. **Media Processing**: Images and videos are ingested and processed to extract frames and prepare them for analysis
2. **Semantic Understanding**: The BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model analyzes each image to understand its content and provides captions.
3. **Indexing**: Tantivy search engine creates efficient indices for quick retrieval.
4. **Query Processing**: User queries are processed and matched against the semantic index.
5. **Result Ranking**: Results are ranked by relevance and presented to the user.


In the following sections, we'll explore the architecture and technical details that make ViZearch possible.
